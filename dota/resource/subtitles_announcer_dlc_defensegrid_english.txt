		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_roshan_fallen_rad_04"		"This just in: Radiant slays Roshan. Details uneccessary."

		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_welcome_05"		"Lets show them what you and I can accomplish together! Dota!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_welcome_06"		"Time to defend the Ancients my friend, let's do this!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_welcome_07"		"Defend the cores! I mean Ancients, yes Ancients."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_welcome_08"		"Hello, excellent to be partnered up once more - let's show them what we can do."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_welcome_09"		"Excellent seeing you again, let's dive into the competition, shall we?"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_welcome_10"		"Why hello there. I'm thinking about playing some Dota, what about you?"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_welcome_11"		"Welcome. The water's lovely -- why don't we dive right on in?"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_welcome_12"		"Greetings my friend, so good to see you. Shall we play a game or three?"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_type_all_pick"		"All Pick."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_type_all_mid"		"All Mid!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_type_least_played"		"Least Played!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_type_all_pick_01"		"All Pick - This will require you to make a choice. But that's life isn't it, one choice after another?"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_type_all_random"		"All Random."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_type_all_random_01"		"All Random - Leave your fate to chance. As if it was ever any other way!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_type_capt_draft"		"Captain's Draft."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_type_capt_mode"		"Captains Mode."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_type_random_draft"		"Random Draft."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_type_random_draft_01"		"Random Draft - be a good sport and pick a card, any card"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_type_single_draft"		"Single Draft."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_type_single_draft_01"		"Single Draft - let's see what you can do with just three choices."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_type_death_match"		"Death Match."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_type_death_match_01"		"Death Match - hmm, that sounds rather unpleasant."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_type_easy_mode"		"Easy Mode."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_type_easy_mode_01"		"Easy mode - That actually sounds quite relaxing."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_type_reverse_cm"		"Reverse Captain's Mode."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_type_future_mode"		"Interesting Choice, Hmmm."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_spectat_01"		"I admit the anticipation is almost unbearable. I wonder first move will be?"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_spectat_02"		"Clearly each team is sizing the other up before striking."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_spectat_05"		"Hah, I'm sensing a particularly clever strategy at work here."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_spectat_06"		"Perhaps we can gain additional insight by watching very closely."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_spectat_07"		"I can guess at what they're up to. But it is rather interesting, isn't it?"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_spectat_08"		"Oh Look! Wait, I'm sorry, that was just a shadow."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_spectat_13"		"I can see the strain on each side. No easy victory here!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_spectat_14"		"It can't be much longer now... any raspberries in those bushes?"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_victory_dire"		"Dire victory!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_victory_dire_01"		"The Dire have claimed victory - what a performance!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_victory_dire_02"		"The Dire prevails, proving their mettle once again!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_victory_dire_03"		"And, yes,... it's the Dire with the win!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_victory_dire_04"		"I must admit, I didn't see it coming, but the Dire pull it off!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_victory_dire_05"		"I must congratulate the Dire - an absolutely smashing success for them!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_victory_rad"		"Radiant victory!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_victory_rad_01"		"There cannot be a question: the win goes to the Radiant!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_victory_rad_02"		"A Radiant victory all around!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_victory_rad_03"		"The Radiant has the victory and I must say they've earned it."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_victory_rad_04"		"And so the Radiant claim victory and the day. As they should!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_victory_rad_05"		"Thus the Radiant seize the win!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_victory_01"		"Congratulations! You've proven your mettle and beaten back the enemy!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_victory_02"		"They'll think twice before challenging us again!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_victory_03"		"It's just too bad there's no one left to complain about that one. Oh, no wait, it isn't too bad all!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_victory_04"		"Well done - Now you have time for a rest - a very very short rest."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_victory_05"		"No surprise to me in the slightest - but you've done it!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_victory_06"		"Now THAT is what this world should look like - free of the enemy!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_victory_07"		"I believe we are, finally, secure. Well done!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_victory_08"		"If I didn't know better I'd say you'd been preparing your entire life for this."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_victory_09"		"A hard fought battle and a sweet, sweet victory!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_victory_10"		"I'll be savoring that victory for quite some time, I should think."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_defeat_01"		"Well, that was unfortunate - let's try something else."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_defeat_02"		"We can't always get it right, can we? Let's give it another go."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_defeat_03"		"I'm sure we can think of another way to proceed. At least, I think I'm sure..."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_defeat_04"		"Right. Another go, then?"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_defeat_05"		"I am absolutely certain we can take them. Let's have another go, shall we?"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_defeat_06"		"No surprise here, you're constantly improving."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_defeat_07"		"Experience is the key. And now you have it. Let's go again!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_defeat_08"		"Steady improvement wins the game. We'll take them yet."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_defeat_09"		"All things are possible with time and patience. And we have both."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_defeat_10"		"Mastery comes in small steps. Onward, friend!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_followup_positive_1"		"Failure is the forge of victory. Back at them!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_followup_positive_2"		"A simple job, simply done. Perfect."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_followup_positive_3"		"Well done!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_followup_positive_4"		"Rather like clockwork for you, isn't it? Excellent."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_followup_positive_5"		"I can see improvement in your every move."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_followup_neg_01"		"Not quite it, but ever so close. Carry on."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_followup_neg_02"		"I'm afraid that's not it, but I have complete faith in you."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_followup_respawn_01"		"Well, Hello there! And welcome back!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_followup_respawn_02"		"I've been wondering where your travels had taken you."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_followup_respawn_03"		"Welcome back, it's been far too long, my friend."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_followup_respawn_04"		"Excellent. You've returned - let's do this, shall we?"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_followup_respawn_05"		"Very happy to see you my friend, shall we engage in some mayham?"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_followup_respawn_06"		"Don't give in now -- you've almost got it."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_followup_respawn_07"		"Not it, but ever so close."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_followup_respawn_08"		"I must insist we try that once again."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_followup_respawn_09"		"I do believe you're getting the right idea."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_followup_respawn_10"		"All indications are that you're getting the hang of it now."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_followup_respawn_11"		"Fantastic! You've nearly got it!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_followup_respawn_12"		"That almost worked!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_followup_respawn_13"		"You can do this, of that I am quite sure. "
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_followup_respawn_14"		"No worries, I'm behind you all the way"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_followup_respawn_15"		"There is no I in quit: oh, wait there is -- but you still shouldn't do it."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_followup_respawn_16"		"I have no doubt that we can do this!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_connection_disconnect_01"		"Someone has disconnected from the game - it's a shame really, they had such potential."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_connection_disconnect_02"		"Someone disconnected."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_connection_reconnect_01"		"A player has returned, we welcome them with open arms, unless of course they're on the other team..."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_connection_reconnect_02"		"A player returns."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_item_purchase_01"		"I'd buy that item too, if I could."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_item_purchase_02"		"Well purchased."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_item_purchase_03"		"Nicely spent."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_item_purchase_04"		"A fine pick up."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_item_purchase_05"		"Now you'll be able to take on even more."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_unpause_01"		"Let's get back to the action!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_unpause_02"		"Right, now back to it!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_unpause_03"		"We now return our regularly scheduled carnage!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_unpause_04"		"No more time to rest, stay sharp!"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_quit_confirm_01"		"Really, already?"
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_quit_confirm_02"		"Well, lets do this again soon. Very soon."
		"announcer_dlc_defensegrid_announcer_quit_confirm_03"		"I think we should do this again sometime."
