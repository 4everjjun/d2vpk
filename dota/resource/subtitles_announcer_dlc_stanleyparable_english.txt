		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_battle_begin_07"		"The match has begun! Go forth, and prove that video games are art!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_battle_begin_08"		"It's time for fantasy-world avatars to pretend to murder one another!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_battle_begin_09"		"MID! EVERYONE GO MID! EVERYONE!!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_battle_begin_10"		"God I really hope this match ends up being of any cosmic significance."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_battle_begin_11"		"aaaaaaand RESOLVE YOUR DIFFERENCES!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_battle_begin_12"		"Remember that we at Dota HQ recommend regular breaks to stretch and move around a bit every 10 minutes or so during play."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_battle_begin_13"		"Let's play, everyone. Let's all play."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_battle_begin_14"		"Okay, so let me impart a bit of wisdom: Don't die. Just do that, keep doing that, over and over and over until the match is finished."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_battle_begin_15"		"And so they rushed eagerly to battle. But all was not what it seemed...."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_battle_begin_16"		"And yet even as the match began, the end was so much closer than anyone knew..."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_battle_begin_17"		"Why are we here? What is any of this for? These are the questions no one was asking."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_battle_begin_18"		"I respect you all regardless of the outcome. But I can't love you. Not after last time..."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_battle_begin_19"		"What none of the players know is that winning will not confer any true meaning or deeper sense of validation upon them as individuals. Let's observe."

		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_cour_kill_rad_02"		"Ashamed of its past, and its horrific crimes, Radiant's courier has just thrown itself onto an enemy blade."

		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_cour_kill_rad_04"		"A scourge upon the earth is no more. Radiant's courier has been killed."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_cour_kill_rad_05"		"Every time Radiant's courier dies, a second courier in another game of Dota gains the strength of a hundred couriers and wins the game."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_cour_kill_rad_06"		"Hopefully we've learned from Radiant's courier how not to welcome the dark tide of evil into your heart"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_cour_kill_rad_07"		"A courier from Radiant's army dies, and a piece of evil incarnate is lifted from the world"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_cour_kill_rad_08"		"We may forget Radiant's courier, but we'll never forgive it. Never."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_cour_kill_rad_09"		"Radiant's courier died as it lived: filled inwardly with shame."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_cour_kill_rad_10"		"Radiant's courier is dead, and before it ever learned to actually care for another living being."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_cour_kill_rad_11"		"Thank god...Radiant's courier is gone...at last, peace may return to these lands."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_cour_kill_rad_12"		"Another of Radiant's couriers dies with its essence marred in blackness."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_cour_kill_rad_13"		"Until near its death, none of us suspected the repulsive hatred that lay buried in the heart of Radiant's courier."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_defeat_02"		"An incredible strategy! With no Ancient for them to defeat, they can no longer win! Victory is assured!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_defeat_05"		"We've nearly got them, push! They're down to their last legs! Everyone push! "
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_defeat_06"		"Well, you lost. You should know that I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed at how furious I am at you for losing."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_victory_03"		"YES! You've achieved a sense of self-worth as a person! Never again will you seek validation from others! What a joyous, joyous day!"

		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_victory_01"		"YOU WON!!! YEEEEEEEESS!!!! WOOO HOOO!!!!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_victory_dire_01"		"The Dire understand Dota better than the Radiant do!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_victory_dire_02"		"The Dire win! Truly, truly today we have video games'd."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_victory_dire_03"		"Today Dire were more video games than Radiant."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_victory_rad_01"		"Praise the Radiant and their knowledge of meta-systems to manipulate the flow of battle!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_victory_rad_03"		"The Radiant beat the Dire at Dota, but does that make them the REAL winners? Think about it."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_defeat_01"		"I don't blame you for losing, I blame all the choices you made and the things you did."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_defeat_03"		"Remember how I said you were a winner in my heart no matter what the outcome of battle? Exactly, I didn't."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_defeat_04"		"Now now, there are other things in life than Dota. Like a personality! Yes, you could go and develop a personality! That'll show 'em!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_defeat_07"		"Wow, what a truly compelling match! Let's listen back on a few of the more memorable moments. Your ancient is under attack. Your ancient is under attack. Your ancient is under attack. Your ancient is under attack. "
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_defeat_10"		"Well, congratulations on not being able to knock down their tree. Literally, their ancient is a tree and yours is the protrusion of unholy evil and you STILL - okay forget it, whatever. Dota."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_victory_dire_04"		"Either the Dire or the Radiant win! It was either a compelling match or a boring match, or somewhere in the middle! DIGITAL SPORTS!!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_victory_dire_05"		"And there you have it ladies and gentlemen, DIGITAL SPORTS!!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_victory_dire_07"		"And there you have it! Well I'd say we all learned absolutely nothing about ourselves as people today. But we learned even less about each other. And in the end, that's the only true meaning of Christmas."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_victory_dire_08"		"And that was Dota! Why don't we round things out today with a nice long beep. BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_victory_dire_09"		"So it seems we've come to the end. But as they say in Dota, the end is never the end is never the end is - STATIC"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_victory_rad_06"		"Well you just spent a bunch of time watching tree people kill a glowing rock. I hope this experience enriches and enlightens the rest of your day."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_victory_05"		"You did it! But I think the real winner today is DIGITAL SPORTS!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_victory_dire_06"		"Well you just watched a bunch of monsters knock down a tree. I hope this information is of any compelling significance to you AFTER you get up from the computer."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_victory_dire"		"Dire victory!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_victory_rad"		"Radiant victory!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_victory_02"		"Wait, you WON?? I really should have written some victory conditions, let me see....ah! Here's one! *ahem* Good."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_victory_04"		"Aha! I knew that you could win! Like, it was physically possible as an outcome of the match. TOTALLY didn't think it would happen though."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_victory_06"		"You feel that? What you're feeling right now? True happiness! I know, I can't believe it comes from winning Dota either, but there you have it!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_victory_07"		"Ah, you've won! As per our prior agreement, I absolve you of all your sins against humanity and decency. Come back if you need another!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_victory_08"		"You've won Dota 2! Please join us for Dota 3: The Threequel: Sequel to Dota 2: The Return of Dota!"

		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_missing_top_01"		"You DO know there's no one on top lane, right?"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_missing_top_02"		"Top is missing."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_missing_top_follow_01"		"I think."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_missing_mid_01"		"Wait, where did everyone in the middle go?"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_missing_mid_02"		"Middle is missing."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_missing_mid_follow_01"		"If they gank, don't say I didn't warn you."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_missing_bot_01"		"Oh look at that, no heroes on bottom."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_missing_bot_02"		"Bottom is missing."

		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_player_disconnect"		"A player has disconnected."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_player_disconnect_01"		"One of us has become too intimidated by the sheer power of electronic sports to continue playing"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_player_disconnect_02"		"ONE of you has figured out that there are actually things in this world other than Dota."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_player_disconnect_03"		"Fine. Leave. See if I care."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_player_disconnect_04"		"Someone left? But they're going to miss the DIGITAL SPORTS."

		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_player_reconnect_04"		"Now all of a sudden you want back in? For goodness sake, make up your mind."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_player_reconnect_05"		"Ha! I knew they couldn't stay away."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_unpause_01"		"Okay back to killing each other!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_unpause_02"		"Okay back to video games!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_unpause_03"		"Once again: video games!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_unpause_04"		"Once again: DIGITAL SPORTS!"

		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_player_quit_03"		"Congratulations on your decision to do things other than Dota, I think you'll find it a wise long-term investment."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_player_quit_04"		"They say that the real victory is NOT playing Dota, which makes you a winner!"

		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_player_quit_07"		"Push escape and press quit, there's no other way to beat this game!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_idle_01"		"Incredible, you've managed to make the most intricate video game on the planet boring. Where do you keep getting it?"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_idle_02"		"Can we PLEASE bring a little excitement back to the game? How about one of you kill your own courier, yes that would really spice things up!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_idle_03"		"Do you know how many hundreds of thousands of hours Valve put into developing this game? Any clue? I ask because right now you're making it look like Snakes and Ladders."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_idle_04"		"I think what we need right now is a bit of music to bring back the mood. MUSIC"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_idle_05"		"Ladies and gentlemen, DIGITAL SPORTS!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_idle_06"		"Look at the radical twists and turns this game is taking, you can just FEEL the video games, can't you? I know I can."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_idle_07"		"When nothing of any interest had happened for a good long time, Stanley decided perhaps this match was going nowhere, and he went to spectate something else."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_idle_08"		"The next time someone claims video games are not art, I'm going to show them a replay of this match."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_idle_09"		"Why don't we spice this match up with a fact about shrimp:"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_shrimp_01"		"Did you know the female shrimp can lay up to a hundred million eggs at once? Wow, that's....that number seems a bit high, actually."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_shrimp_02"		"Did you know that average shrimp lifespan is between 12 and 16 minutes? Wow, I sure know a lot more about shrimp than I did before this match!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_shrimp_03"		"Did you know that shrimp subclass Branchiopoda, order Anostraca are on average 3 inches smaller than the more common branchiopods Notostraca, Diplostraca and Mysidacea? .....okay!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_shrimp_04"		"Did you know that the first shrimp was discovered in 1967 by a group of Finnish sailors? I didn't either, facts can really be surprising!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_shrimp_05"		"Did you know that shrimp are healthy source of protein and selenium? I did, and I use this information on a regular basis!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_respawn_01"		"Do it again! Exactly like you did the last time!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_respawn_02"		"Respawned again. Does it ever bother you that you'll never know the sweet release of lasting death? Bothers ME all the time."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_respawn_03"		"Oh look! It's alternate you who stopped playing Dota and went outside! Just look how fit and attractive you are!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_respawn_04"		"SEND IN THE NEXT CLONE."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_respawn_05"		"Okay this time just do everything exactly the opposite of what you did before."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_respawn_06"		"Can anyone TRULY die? In real life, I mean. I - wait, yes, okay, I've answered my own question."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_respawn_07"		"What is it all for? Dying, resurrecting, dying again, resurrecting again.......why???"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_respawn_07_resp"		"Oh wait, yes, I'm sorry, you're trying to kill their ancient. Okay, got it, as you were!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_respawn_08"		"WELCOME BACK TO DOTAAAAA! GUITAR"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_respawn_09"		"Okay this time, let me offer a new piece of strategy:"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_respawn_advice_01"		"More couriers. Buy more couriers."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_respawn_advice_02"		"Top lane, only go top lane."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_respawn_advice_03"		"Jungle. Just jungle, nothing else, only jungle."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_respawn_advice_04"		"Buy wards. Buy lots of them, fill your inventory."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_respawn_advice_05"		"Kill your courier. Buy another one. Kill that one too."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_respawn_advice_06"		"Sell all your equipment. Hardcore mode."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_respawn_advice_07"		"Feed. Just, constant feeding."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_respawn_advice_08"		"Win."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_respawn_advice_09"		"Go outside."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_respawn_advice_10"		"Stop everything, just take a minute here to reflect. Yes, a good bit of soul searching is what this team needs."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_respawn_advice_11"		"Kill Roshan by yourself. DO IT! DO IT DO IT DO IT DO IT!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_respawn_advice_12"		"Attack your own ancient. Enemies perceive that your team has fallen apart and they become complacent. Allies swoop in while they're vulnerable. VICTORY!!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_respawn_advice_13"		"Stop using mana, you died the last time you tried using mana."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_respawn_advice_14"		"Go on a friend's account and purchase the Stanley Parable Dota pack a second time."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_purchase_01"		"Consume! Consume! Consume!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_purchase_02"		"Quickly! Overanalyze whether or not it was the correct purchase! Choke on your own bitter regret!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_purchase_03"		"People still buy this item? Why don't you pay attention to the meta-game??"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_purchase_04"		"No matter who wins this match, the capitalist pigs are the real winners."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_purchase_05"		"Isn't it nice knowing that material consumption brings lasting happiness?"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_purchase_courier_01"		"Maybe...maybe this time things will be different..."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_purchase_courier_02"		"Go, donkey child. Let not the tides of evil into your heart."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_purchase_courier_03"		"This courier's soul...so immaculate, so pure..."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_purchase_wards_01"		"Congratulations on your new sentry ward! Best of luck on a lifetime of never receiving any substantial recognition for your work!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_purchase_wards_02"		"Look at you, sucking it up and buying the sentry ward. Surely your team will recognize you for your sacrifices."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_purchase_wards_03"		"Buying a sentry ward makes you the least powerful hero in the game, but it makes you most powerful in my heart."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_purchase_tango"		"Ah the Tango... The poor man's Divine Rapier..."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_purchase_desolator"		"Ah the Desolator... The poor man's Divine Rapier..."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_purchase_defiance"		"Ah the Hood of Defiance... The poor man's Divine Rapier..."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_purchase_aquila"		"Ah the Ring of Aquila... The poor man's Divine Rapier..."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_purchase_slipper"		"Ah the Slipper of Agility... The poor man's Divine Rapier..."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_purchase_urn"		"Ah the Urn of Shadows... The poor man's Divine Rapier..."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_purchase_smoke"		"People actually buy smokes? Really???"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_purchase_clarity"		"Interestingly, THIS clarity will actually deplete your mana."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_purchase_divinerapier_02"		"Well done! Well done!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_type_all_pick"		"Today we'll be playing All Pick."

		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_welcome_01"		"Welcome to Dota!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_welcome_02"		"Oh good, you're back! It's been too long since I bathed in human misery."

		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_welcome_05"		"Welcome! Once again! To DIGITAL SPORTS!"
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_welcome_06"		"Stanley began a game of Dota. It would be a long time before Stanley stopped playing Dota."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_welcome_07"		"Welcome, to the dense and impenetrable web of systemic bullshit we collectively refer to as Dota."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_welcome_08"		"Welcome to Dota 2, hope you're ready to get meta."
		"announcer_dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_welcome_09"		"Aha, I knew you would be back. It was never really a choice."
