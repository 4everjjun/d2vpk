		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_prelim_05"		"Oh good, you're back."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_prelim_06"		"Welcome to Ota. The D is silent."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_prelim_07"		"Hello."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_prelim_08"		"You're back. You must really enjoy crushing defeat."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_prelim_10"		"Today is a good day to die in a forest defending a statue from goblins."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_prelim_11"		"Hello. I hope you're ready this time."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_prelim_12"		"You must be the one the others were talking about. The--well, I'm sure you'll find out."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_prelim_13"		"You must be the one the others were talking about. That talentless one."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_prelim_14"		"Welcome to Dota. It's the hot new game you've been reading about in your eating magazines."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_prelim_15"		"Welcome to Dota. Don't forget your little plastic sword. And all your chins. And your giant flagon of gravy."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_prelim_16"		"Welcome to Medieval Times. How many in your party tonight?"
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_prelim_17"		"Welcome to Dota. It's like chess with one piece and a forest."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_prelim_19"		"You must be the ones the others were talking about. The one with all the chins."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_prelim_20"		"Welcome to Dota."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_gamemode_01"		"All pick."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_gamemode_09"		"Mid only."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_gamemode_11"		"Least played."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_gamemode_02"		"All random."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_gamemode_03"		"Captain's draft."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_gamemode_04"		"Captain's mode."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_gamemode_05"		"Random draft."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_gamemode_06"		"Single draft."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_gamemode_07"		"Death match."

		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_gamemode_10"		"Reverse captain's mode."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_gamemode_12"		"You're not going to like this one."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_gamemode_14"		"Oh good, something new to fail at."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_gamemode_15"		"This is new."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_gamemode_16"		"This looks challenging. For you, I mean."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_gamemode_17"		"I don't want to tell you your business, but if it were me I'd leave this new game mode alone."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_gamemode_18"		"I wouldn't bother with this mode. My guess is that just clicking it will make your life even worse somehow."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_gamemode_19"		"I was getting bored watching you lose in those other modes anyway."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_spectat_01"		"Don't wear out the edge of your seat."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_spectat_03"		"Gripping, isn't it?"
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_spectat_04"		"You paid for the whole seat, so get comfortable because it looks like we may be here a long time."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_spectat_05"		"I know, I can't wait either."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_spectat_06"		"Here's a Dota play-by-play. That fat, batwinged thing just flew left. A goblin punched a... ghost I think. Good for him. Good for everyone. Anyway: Dota."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_spectat_07"		"So, what's happening here then? Oh! The game's still on. Gripping, isn't it?"
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_spectat_09"		"I spy with my robot eye something that makes no sense. Did you guess everything that's going on here? Because this is all nonsense."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_event_neg_23"		"The game already started, by the way. I wasn't sure if you were waiting for a whistle. There isn't one."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_mia_bot_01"		"The bottom lane is missing."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_mia_bot_02"		"Bottom is missing."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_mia_mid_01"		"The middle lane is missing."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_mia_mid_02"		"Middle is missing."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_mia_top_01"		"The top lane is missing."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_mia_top_02"		"Top is missing."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_neg_01"		"Thanks to you."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_neg_02"		"That's bad, by the way."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_neg_04"		"I honestly, truly didn't think you'd allow that to happen."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_neg_05"		"You're allowed to defend those, you know."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_neg_06"		"Because of poor decisions. Yours most likely."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_neg_08"		"Because someone--I'm talking about you here--doesn't know what they're doing."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_neg_10"		"What counts is that you tried, so maybe do that next time."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_neg_11"		"There are no handicaps on this match by the way. You can stop them from doing that."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_neg_12"		"If you were saving your real strategy for a crisis, now would be the time."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_neg_13"		"That outfit you're wearing looks stupid. That's not me talking. It's right here in your file."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_neg_14"		"When other people play that hero it looks fine. But right here a scientist has noted that when you play it it looks stupid."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_neg_15"		"Grief counseling will be available at the conclusion of the match."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_neg_16"		"But on the bright side, I just won. Money. Gambling money. By betting against you."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_neg_17"		"But we're all winners here. Especially those players over there. In the enemy camp. You know, the ones celebrating."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_neg_18"		"Interesting stategy. Let them obliterate all your defenses, then swoop in for the kill."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_neg_19"		"That doesn't mean you have to like it. It just means you'll probably keep doing it because of your aptitude at failure."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_neg_20"		"But don't worry, losing builds character. In fact it's making you a better person right now. A great, big, well-rounded loser with lots of personality."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_neg_21"		"But looking at it another way, I think you've won a real moral victory here. Which doesn't mean we should forget about the first way. The more accurate and humiliating way."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_neg_22"		"But it's not a big loss really. It's one in a series of very small losses over a 45 minute timespan that, when added up, will look like one big, spectacular failure."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_neg_23"		"Well nobody will hold it against you. Let's be honest, I doubt anyone will even find it surprising."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_neg_24"		"Now you're really in for it."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_neg_26"		"I can't even begin to describe how badly you've screwed this up. Oh wait, I just did."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_neg_28"		"If I was a betting artificial intelligence, I'd put money on them killing you now."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_neg_29"		"That's bad, by the way."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_neg_30"		"That doesn't mean you have to like it."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_neutral_followup_01"		"This should be interesting."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_neutral_followup_02"		"I was on the edge of my seat."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_neutral_followup_05"		"Let's watch and see what happens."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_neutral_followup_08"		"Good."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_neutral_followup_10"		"In case you weren't paying attention."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_event_neg_01"		"If that's something you cared about."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_event_neg_02"		"It's probably nothing to worry about."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_event_neg_03"		"You might want to look into that."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_event_neg_04"		"So there's that."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_event_neg_05"		"You're allowed to start trying now."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_event_neg_06"		"But you probably already knew that."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_event_neg_07"		"Not that I care one way or the other."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_event_neg_08"		"So that's something that's happening."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_event_neg_09"		"But just continue doing whatever it was you were doing."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_event_neg_11"		"I hope that's part of your plan."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_event_neg_12"		"You don't even care, do you?"
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_event_neg_13"		"It'll probably be fine."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_event_neg_15"		"Is this part of an elaborate trap you're going to spring on them later? Because it looks like they're really falling for it."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_event_neg_16"		"I know it's not a plate of nachos or anything, but it is important to the game."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_event_neg_17"		"It's probably fine. Trust me: I'm a super-computer and I barely understand what's happening right now."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_event_neg_18"		"I only mention it as a conversation starter. How are you doing otherwise?"
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_event_neg_19"		"Let me put it in old English so that it will penetrate your wizard's cap: thou art losing."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_event_neg_20"		"You're really losing now. Or winning. Well, back to my mad-libs."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_event_neg_21"		"Wait, maybe they're not actually damaging it. No, they are."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_event_neg_22"		"I know. I don't care either."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_event_neg_25"		"This is the hardest part about being an impartial announcer: balancing how little I care about anything that's happening here."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_neutral_followup_04"		"Bad news for you fans of towers out there."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_spectat_02"		"Yes, yes. Oh that was a great mad-lib. So, what's happening here then?"
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_pos_01"		"Don't get cocky."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_pos_02"		"Don't let it go to your fat, jowly head."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_pos_03"		"Don't let it go to your giant, misshapen fantasy head."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_pos_04"		"So at least your teammates know what they're doing."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_pos_05"		"You're winning the epic battle for this small field with a creek running through it."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_pos_07"		"Here, let me engrave a trophy for you: nobody cares."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_pos_08"		"If this backward, illiterate fantasy forest had a newspaper, you'd be on the front page."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_pos_09"		"Let me record this victory in your file. Where did I put it? Oh, who cares."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_pos_10"		"Your teammates are doing a really great job."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_pos_11"		"They're just going to build another one. They're made of cement. You can buy them at the supermarket."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_pos_13"		"This should impress all the people that doubted you at the comic book store."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_pos_15"		"Why don't you celebrate with two fistfulls of potato chips once you've swallowed the chips you're probably eating now."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_pos_16"		"This is probably the most heroic thing anyone's ever done while sitting motionless in their parents' rec room."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_pos_17"		"You must be so proud of your teammates right now."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_pos_18"		"You were almost helpful that time."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_pos_19"		"Well, you offered moral support."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_pos_20"		"It's a good feeling, isn't it? I wouldn't get used to it."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_pos_21"		"Not bad. Not as bad, I mean, as your other decisions so far."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_pos_22"		"Well, that's probably the game. You win. Hands off the keyboard."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_pos_23"		"Well, aren't you the little hero of the forest."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_pos_24"		"So that's a minor victory, right square in the middle of all your failures."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_pos_26"		"Let's be honest: it probably won't help."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_pos_27"		"For all the good it will do you."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_pos_28"		"If you had any idea what you were doing, this would be a real achievement."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_pos_29"		"By accident, if I had to guess."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_pos_30"		"Did you win? I don't have the first clue what's happening right now. What about those things? The tree-people things. Are they important?"
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_pos_31"		"You're winning. More accurately, you're on the same team as winners who happen to be near you while they win. Anyway, congradulations."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_pos_34"		"That's funny, I didn't even see you cheat."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_pos_38"		"That should delay the inevitable slightly."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_ally_pos_39"		"Let's be honest: it probably won't help."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_exitgame_01"		"Based on the way you've been playing, I understand."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_followup_respaw_01"		"Oh good. You're back."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_followup_respaw_02"		"Oh, you were gone. Because nobody noticed."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_followup_respaw_03"		"You're back. That's... great."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_followup_respaw_04"		"You're going to break that respawner using it so much. It wasn't built for this kind of traffic."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_followup_respaw_05"		"I hope you bought the fire gauntlets of strength goblet boots. I don't understand any of this."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_followup_respaw_06"		"You again."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_followup_respaw_07"		"You're terrifying reign of dying continues."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_followup_respaw_08"		"Well, see you back here soon."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_followup_respaw_09"		"Just because we can bring you back from the dead doesn't mean you can't dodge occasionally."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_followup_respaw_13"		"I thought you were dead. I'll let everyone who was worried about you know-okay I'm done."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_followup_respaw_14"		"Oh, you're back from whatever idiotic afterlife your prepostrous race believes in."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_followup_respaw_16"		"Get back to battle. I think there's still a spot of ground out there that doesn't have your blood on it."
		"announcer_dlc_glados_ann_glados_followup_respaw_17"		"They struck you down, but you've come back stronger! Wait, I'm sorry. I meant heavier. In the face. Anyway, waddle out there and do your best."
